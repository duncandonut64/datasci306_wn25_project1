## Overview

In the `data` directory of this project you will find the file from a paper published in *Nature Energy* titled [Natural gas savings in Germany during the 2022 energy crisis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-023-01260-5). Here is the abstract of the article:

> Russia curbed its natural gas supply to Europe in 2021 and 2022, creating a grave energy crisis. This Article empirically estimates the crisis response of natural gas consumers in Germanyâ€”for decades, the largest export market for Russian gas. Using a multiple regression model, we estimate the response of small consumers, industry and power stations separately, controlling for the nonlinear temperature-heating relationship, seasonality and trends. We find significant and substantial gas savings for all consumer groups, but with differences in timing and size. For instance, industry started reducing consumption as early as September 2021, while small consumers saved substantially only since March 2022. Across all sectors, gas consumption during the second half of 2022 was 23% below the temperature-adjusted baseline. We discuss the drivers behind these savings and draw conclusions on their role in coping with the crisis.

Your job in this project falls into two categories:

1. A set of **tasks** that your group must complete exactly
2. A set of **objectives** that are more general in their approach.

## Tasks

### Task 1

* Load two files. To work in the console, use the `Session -> Set Working Directory -> To Source File Location`.
    * Call the first table `daily`: "./data/natural_gas_germany_daily.csv"
    * Call the second table `gas`: "./data/dutch_ttf_natural_gas.csv". Be sure to properly import the `Date` column.
    * Demonstrate that these have been loaded by showing the number of rows and columns in each table.
    

```{r}
daily = read_csv("./data/natural_gas_germany_daily.csv")
gas = read_csv("./data/dutch_ttf_natural_gas.csv")

print("Daily Dimensions:")
dim(daily)
print("Gas Dimensions:")
dim(gas)

```
  

### Task 2

* The data in `daily` are collected over days, with information on different types of natural gas consumption (`consumption_small`, `consumption_industry`, `consumption_power`). Provide summaries of typical values for each of these three types of consumption.

```{r}
summary(daily$consumption_small)
summary(daily$consumption_industry)
summary(daily$consumption_power)
```


### Task 3

Answer some questions about the data in `daily`:

* How many weeks do the data cover?
> The number of weeks covered in the daily data set spans over 312 weeks. 
* What is the percentage change in the `consumption_*` variables (that is the last day minus the first day divided by the first day)?

> The results of the percentage changes in the consumption variables are listed in the following: 
> consumption_small - (NA)
> consumption_industry  - (-49.52467)
> consumption_power  - (-62.04852)

* What proportion of the days are marked as holidays?

>Proportion of days marked as holidays: 0.0361. 

* For each month in each year, what was the year-month combination with the lowest median `consumption_power` value?

> The month with the lowest median consumption_power value is "2021-08 at 0.1634914	median."

```{r}

```

### Task 4

-   The original paper aggregated the data to monthly means for each consumption type in `daily` and the `Price` column of `gas` to produce the following image:<br/> 
![Original consumption by month graph](proj1fig1.png)<br/> Produce plots that show the same information that is presented in this plot. Your plots do not have to have the same colors or markings, but we should be able to use them to compare the trends for the three price variables.

```{r}
month_avg_daily <- daily |>
  mutate(
    month_year = floor_date(as.Date(date), unit = "month")
  ) |>
  group_by(month_year) |>
  summarise(
    price_industry_idx = mean(price_industry_idx, na.rm = TRUE),
    price_households_idx = mean(price_households_idx, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |>
  filter(
    !(
      is.nan(price_industry_idx) | 
      is.nan(price_households_idx)
    )
  )

month_avg_daily |>
  ggplot(aes(
    x = month_year,
    y = price_industry_idx
  )) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Natural Gas Price Index - Industry",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Price Index (2015 = 100)"
  )

month_avg_daily |>
  ggplot(aes(
    x = month_year,
    y = price_households_idx
  )) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Natural Gas Price Index - Households",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Price Index (2015 = 100)"
  )



gas |>
  mutate(
    month_year = floor_date(as.Date(Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"), unit = "month")
  ) |>
  group_by(month_year) |>
  summarise(
    price = mean(Price, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(
    x = month_year,
    y = price
  )) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Natural Gas Price TTF",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Natural Gas Price TTF"
  )
  
```

### Task 5

-   Write a predicate function that returns true if any value in vector is missing. Use this function to find columns with missing values in the `daily` column. Create a plot or table that shows how often patterns of missingness occur: are all of the missing values in the same rows or are the various columns missing data in different ways?

```{r}
any_missing <- function(vec) {
  length(vec[is.na(vec)]) > 0
}

print("Columns with missing values")
missing_cols <- sapply(daily, any_missing)
missing_cols[missing_cols == TRUE] |> names()

daily |>
  arrange(as.Date(date)) |>
  mutate(
    across(
      -date,
      ~ ifelse(is.na(.), "Missing", "Not Missing")
    )
  ) |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -date,
    names_to = "column",
    values_to = "missing"
  ) |>
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = column,
      y = date,
      fill = factor(missing)
    )
  ) +
  geom_tile() +
  labs(
    title = "Missing Data Heatmap",
    x = "Rows",
    y = "Date",
    fill = "Status"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
  


```

### Task 6

-   Limit the `gas` table to days where the price exceeded the yearly median. Use the concept of [circular means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_mean) to compute the average day of the year when price exceeds the yearly median price. The `yday` function will likely be useful here.

```{r}
circular_mean <- function(vec) {
  # 366 since there are leap years
  # Subtract 1 since it goes from 1-366
  vec <- (vec - 1) * 2 * pi / 366
  
  sin_sum <- sin(vec) |> sum()
  cos_sum <- cos(vec) |> sum()
  
  mean_rad <- atan2(sin_sum, cos_sum)
  
  if (mean_rad < 0) {
    mean_rad <- mean_rad + pi
  }
  
  # Return mean converted back to days
  (mean_rad * 366 / (2 * pi)) + 1
}

gas_annual_median <- median(gas$Price, na.rm = TRUE)

gas |>
  filter(Price > gas_annual_median) |>
  mutate(day = yday(as.Date(Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))) |>
  pull(day) |>
  circular_mean()
```

### Task 7

-   Using the cut function, create two nominal variables from quantitative data in the `daily` dataset. Use these groups to summarize the data. Use arrange to show the smallest or largest values in these comparisons.

```{r}

percentile_breaks <- c(-Inf, 50, 75, 90, 100, 110, 125, 150, 200, 250, 300, Inf)
percentile_labels <- c("0-50", "50-75", "75-90", "90-100", "100-110",
                       "110-125", "125-150", "150-200", "200-250", "250-300", "300+")

summarised_daily <- daily |>
  mutate(
    manufacturing_group = cut(
      manufacturing_idx,
      breaks = percentile_breaks,
      labels = percentile_labels,
    ),
    hospitality_group = cut(
      hospitality_idx,
      breaks = percentile_breaks,
      labels = percentile_labels
    )
  ) |>
  group_by(manufacturing_group, hospitality_group) |>
  summarise(
    avg_manufacturing_idx = mean(manufacturing_idx, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_hospitality_idx = mean(hospitality_idx, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

summarised_daily |>
  arrange(avg_manufacturing_idx) |>
  select(!avg_hospitality_idx) |>
  head()

summarised_daily |>
  arrange(avg_hospitality_idx) |>
  select(!avg_manufacturing_idx) |>
  head()
```
   
### Task 8

* There are several variables that pull out data by different industry (the `_idx` columns). Create a table for these columns using `select` and the `ends_with` function. Provide two different plots that show of the relations between these variables (you do not need to have all variables in each plot).

```{r}
daily_idx = select(daily, ends_with("_idx"))

# Plot 1:
ggplot(daily_idx, aes(x = price_households_idx, y = price_industry_idx)) +
  geom_smooth() + 
  labs(title = "Industry Price Index vs. Household Price Index", x = "Household Price Index", y = "Industry Price Index")

# Plot 2:
ggplot(daily_idx, aes(x = price_households_idx, y = hospitality_idx)) +
  geom_smooth() + 
  labs(title = "Hospitality Index vs. Household Price Index", x = "Household Price Index", y = "Hospitality Index")



```



## Objectives

### Objective 1

* Produce at least five more figures. For each figure, write a brief caption explaining the plot and what you have learned from the plot. Each figure should attempt to provide new insight into the data set not included elsewhere
    * A marginal distribution
    * A joint distribution
    * A plot of a summary measure such as a conditional mean
    * A plot using `facet_wrap` or `facet_grid`
    * A plot that shows seasonal effects before the crisis (September 2021 until October 2022)

1.  This is a marginal distribution of `consumption_power` that can show how power station gas consumption changes, and what type of values it generally stays around.

Insight: This shows that power station gas consumption is a right skewed distribution. The general consistency shows that there is a normal range that power stations use, but occasionally, during times of demand, the gas usage spikes. It also means that power demands from gas stay relatively constant most of the time.ÃŸ

```{r}
daily |>
  ggplot(aes(x=consumption_power)) +
  geom_histogram(
    aes(y = after_stat(count)/sum(after_stat(count))), 
    bins = 75, 
    fill = "blue",
    na.rm = TRUE
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of power station gas consumption",
    x = "Power Station Gas Consumption",
    y = "Marginal Frequency",
  )
```

2.  This is a joint distribution that uses a scatter plot to compare temperature with small consumer gas consumption to see if there is any possible relationship.

Insight: Gas consumption is lower at higher temperatures, and decreases as temperatures decrease. This is probably due to reduced need for heating when the temperature is warmer.

```{r}
daily |>
  # Kelvin to Celsius
  mutate(temperature = temperature - 273.15) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = consumption_small, y = temperature)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(
    title = "Temperature vs Small Consumer Gas Consumption",
    x = "Small Consumer Gas Consumption",
    y = "Temperature (Celsius)"
  )
```

3.  Plotting the the mean percentage change in gas price over every day for each month in the data frame.

Insight: It looks like in recent years the average percent change in gas price has become more volatile, with the positive and negative values being further from 0 than before. And the fact that there are daily averages that are a couple of percentage points from 0 shows how different months and time periods have clear cut trends in gas prices across them.

```{r}
gas |>
  # Removes a change of -80%, which doesn't seem real and also occurs in a month with very few data points
  filter(Date != "10/23/2017") |>
  mutate(
    month_year = floor_date(as.Date(Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"), unit = "month"),
    change_percent = as.numeric(gsub("%","",`Change %`))
  ) |>
  group_by(month_year) |>
  summarise(avg_percent_change = mean(change_percent, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = month_year, y = avg_percent_change)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Average percent change in gas price per month",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Average Percent Change"
  )
```

4.  This faceted plot will show a histogram of gas consumption by power stations on each day of the week.

Insight: Looks like the distribution is similar across the work days of the week, but on the weekend, the power companies have a more right skewed distribution. This is initially confusing, since more people are at home on weekends, but it draws out the conclusion that the the gas power stations need to power businesses that are running during the weekdays is generally more than needed on the weekend when people are just at home.

```{r}
daily |>
  ggplot(aes(x = consumption_power)) +
  geom_histogram(na.rm = TRUE, bins = 50) +
  facet_wrap(~weekday, nrow = 3, ncol = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "Industry Gas Consumption per Weekday",
    x = "Industry Gas Consumption",
    y = "Count"
  )
```

5.  

### Objective 2

* Compare and contrast holidays and non-holidays for household energy consumption. Select 3 ways of comparing these groups. Provide at least one graph.

### Objective 3

* According to the paper, the gas crisis occurred between September 2021 until October 2022. Compare this period with the periods before and after on household and industrial consumption. Write a paragraph explaining your findings.

```{r}
ggplot()



```


### Objective 4

* Explore the [documentation for ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). Select one geometery and one `stat_` function we have not used before or use an option to a previously used geometry/stat with a new option. Write a short paragraph explaining what the plots show. 

### Objective 4

* Investigate solar radiation's marginal distribution and also it's relationship with temperature.


### Objective 5

* Use `group_by` to summarize by a new feature of this data set not otherwise discussed in the tasks or objectives. What have you learned with these investigation?

### Objective 6

* Based on your exploration of the data, suggest three questions that could be asked from these data or additional data that you can imagine. Be sure to explain why the previous plots or calculations indicates that this would be an interesting our useful exploration.

### Objective 7

* Write an abstract for your project. Briefly explain what you did, what you found, and why a potential reader should be interested in your research.
